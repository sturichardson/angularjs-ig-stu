# `angular-ig-stu` â€” the rewrite of Stu IG for AngularJS - learning exercise

I originally wrote this product to overcome some limitations in the IG Markets Trading Platform.

There exists a problem where quite regularly after attempting to enter the market, IG Markets would reject
the trade.  This is quite infuriating and my solution was to write my own front end connected to the
IG Markets REST interface.

My solution is quite successful until IG Markets disable their REST interface.
It appears as though whenever there is a situation where they will potentially lose a lot of money, IG markets will
disable their interface.

This is a rewrite of my original product in AngularJS as a learning exercise.
