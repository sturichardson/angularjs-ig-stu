# `angular-ig-stu` â€” the rewrite of Stu IG GWT for AngularJS - a learning exercise

I originally wrote this product to overcome some limitations in the IG Markets Trading Platform.

There exists a problem where quite regularly after attempting to enter the market, IG Markets will reject
the trade.  This can be quite annoying and to solve this problem I wrote my own application connected to the 
IG Markets REST interface.

This is a partial rewrite of my original product in AngularJS as a learning exercise.
